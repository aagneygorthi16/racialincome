<h1>Racial Income Disparity</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p><strong id="docs-internal-guid-17881fb6-7fff-c30e-fe4f-4852979f6b6a">As the world continues to develop economically, we become privy to a plethora of issues concerning the fairness of the distribution of that wealth. Multiple factors come into play when talking about the issue of distribution of wealth. One type of discrimination that goes fairly unnoticed in first-world countries when talking about discrimination is a racial disparity when speaking of income even with its prominence in these first-world countries. It often goes unnoticed that people who are doing the same job get paid less even though they contribute the same amount of work or races that used to be in the poorer class continue to only be a part of society in these low-income jobs because of a lack of opportunities presented to them. Understanding this issue is vital to the coherence of society because this issue poses a threat to the equality of people. In understanding the topic, not only can we create solutions and strategies but can persuade those who have the power to implement this change to take action. While you are reading this website, families are suffering just because of the color of their skin and the community in which they were raised which means that the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. A society in which this imbalance is created is not a functioning economy but rather one that is weak and unstable.

<h2>The Gini Coefficent  </h2>
<p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-cb44be2a-7fff-7895-0a92-8d1efee4e8f9">In the 1900s the global economy continued to grow more and more, this would mean that a lot of the issues that this world faced in terms of the income distribution would come to light. The measure this income disparity the Gini coefficient was developed by an Italian Statiscian named Corrado Gini in 1912. This coefficient remains the best way to analyze income disparity in the world today. This is also known as the Gini Index</strong></p>
<br />
<p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-cb44be2a-7fff-7895-0a92-8d1efee4e8f9">The coefficient is measured from 0 to 1 or 0 % to 100 %, 0 meaning that there is absolutely no income equality present in the population given and 100% or 1 meaning that there is complete inequality present in that society, there is a possibility though of having the number higher than 1, this happens when talking about negative income in the economy. This would mean that in an economy where everyone earned the exact same amount of money, the coefficient would be 0 while in an economy where everyone earned nothing and only one person earned everything, then the coefficient would be 1.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<br />
<p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-cb44be2a-7fff-7895-0a92-8d1efee4e8f9">Most of the time, the Gini Index is represented through the Lorenz Graph, which plots the population percentile by income. From here, to get the Gini Index, you have to find the area underneath this graph.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Prominent Countries</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-be0cd1a4-7fff-91d4-59e4-89f2dfc84e86">To comprehend the situation, we must understand countries that are highly affected by this situation and understand the reasoning behind it. In these examples, I will be talking about South Africa, and the United States of America and then talk about the broad understanding of the entire planet.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<br />
<p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-be0cd1a4-7fff-91d4-59e4-89f2dfc84e86">South Africa:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-be0cd1a4-7fff-91d4-59e4-89f2dfc84e86">South Africa has the highest Gini Index of any country in the world, this is almost solely because of the racial income disparity present in South Africa. 80 percent of the wealth is owned by 10 percent of the country, 85 percent of that 10 percent is white. Out of 164 countries, South Africa ranks first by a margin, having a Gini Index of 63, 4 more than their African counterpart Namibia. South Africa still struggles from extreme poverty, and below one percent of the poverty population is white. South Africa has historically been a divided state but the division is clear after looking at the economic difference between the people. South Africa&rsquo;s poverty rate is so high that it has the highest percentage of citizens below the poverty line. A lot of this may have to do with the fact that because a lot of the black population lives in bad communities, they don&rsquo;t have a great education, therefore, cannot get a high-paying job though racism is still considered to be a very prominent factor in South Africa. The adverse effects of the apartheid movement are still present in the form of the number of colored people in these poverty-stricken establishments.</strong></p>
<strong id="docs-internal-guid-f3d5bada-7fff-a4e6-ef43-9721af44a140">
<p dir="ltr">United States of America:</p>
<p dir="ltr">Though on paper the United States does not look like it has an issue in terms of income disparity, it requires an integration of statistics and social developments to understand the amount of income disparity in the United States of America by race. The reason income disparity here can also be related to social issues is because of the recent BLM movements in the USA. Therefore a viewer can take into account that the USA is already on the shaky ground when it comes to equality in the race. Combine that with the fact that the USA has a Gini Index of 41.50, the highest of any developed country in the world, it shows that racial income disparity can be present anywhere, no matter how stable a country might look. The federal reserve bank of America states that the average white person makes over 6 times more than the average Black person and 5 times more than the average Hispanic person. This is because of the poor neighborhoods versus the rich neighborhoods. In fact, the science known as Neighborhood Poverty helps us understand the effect of neighborhoods on racial income disparity. In the USA, high poverty neighborhoods are only made up of 4.3 percent of Americans even though they make up 61.9 percent of the population. </p>

<p dir="ltr">Rest of the world:</p>
<p dir="ltr">When looking at the Gini Index of other countries it is clear that the top ones are mostly African countries, this is because of the high black population. To this day, the black population is paid far less than their counterparts even though they populate most of the countries that suffer from high-income disparity rates. Racial Income Disparity is present in all countries, there is no country in the world with a zero but the difference is clearly visible in prominnently black countries such as those in Africa. </p>

  Racism in Income Disparity</h2>
<p><strong id="docs-internal-guid-42cc90cd-7fff-79d3-9d10-34911ab10e7a">Racism is easily the biggest factor in Racial Income Disparity, though as humans beings, most of us have evolved in the perception of character, some people still judge people&rsquo;s character by the color of their skin. A lot of times this may be unintentional, through numerous studies, it has been shown that a boss or supervisor is more likely to promote a white man as compared to his black counterpart. Studies in the New York Time suggests that no matter the neighborhood the person comes out of, black men tend to earn way less than white men. Stereotypes are also a huge part of racism, a lot of people think that a black person is inherently a lot less smart than a white man or that a black man is more violent than a black man, with perceptions like this, companies and corporations hire more white people and therefore minimum wage jobs go to those who are colored. Not only do black people suffer from this but also Hispanics and Native Americans are seen as unfair stereotypes, therefore, are given a lot fewer opportunities than white people. </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Historical Premise</h2>
<p><br />
</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-4c4ff887-7fff-3c3e-478b-6a50632a359a">Though the issue may seem bleak because of the drastic news, we have become a lot better in terms of equality in the past few centuries. Slavery used to be a very common theme in countries, now it is completely mitigated, not only is it fully illegal but it is unheard of in today&rsquo;s day and age which means that everyone gets paid for their job. The integration of races has also never been better, the apartheid was the biggest divider between races, but after Nelson Mandala and activists got rid of the apartheid, black and white people were allowed to work the same jobs. In the USA, Martin Luther King, Rosa Parks, Malcolm X, etc, changed how unified we are in the world. Though our planet may not seem perfect, we as a society are a lot more prosperous than we were a century ago. </strong></p>
<h2><br>
  Implemented Solutions
</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-14bced9d-7fff-274c-2f06-c4aa5adbcd8e">The biggest solution that has been implemented is public education, in 95 percent of the countries education is free up until high school/college. This would mean that people are now able to gain knowledge without having to spend money, therefore families that could not earlier afford school, now can. This would mean that with the education, that family member can earn money, and then using that money, they can help the next family member down the line. This would break the cycle and would get a family out of poverty. We have also seen solutions such as free health care, which means that more people will seek medical help because it&rsquo;s free therefore the life expectancy of that place can grow, families can now also spend less money on health care, therefore, saving money.&nbsp; </strong></p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Possible Solutions</h2>
<strong id="docs-internal-guid-024ce058-7fff-1277-9106-69b13495fa8f">
<p dir="ltr">The tax rate for the planet is at an all-time high and this is the worst for those who struggle to pay these taxes. In a lot of the tax codes on the planet, we are in, charge less for those who earn more, there must be a change in this tax system because otherwise, it does not account for the poor. There also must be an increase in the minimum wage, the minimum wage the income is very low, which means that the people who need the money the most are getting it the least. Through these methods mitigation of Racial Income Disparity is possible.&nbsp;</p>
